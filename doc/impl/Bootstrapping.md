# Bootstrapping the Virgil Compiler #

Virgil is a programming language designed for building *systems*, such as virtual machines, kernels, networking stacks, databases, etc.
Such software usually runs directly on the CPU, rather that itself on a virtual machine or interpreter, and thus necessitates a *compiler* that translates Virgil source code to native (machine) code.

The Virgil compiler [Aeneas](../../aeneas/src/) serves the role of both an interpreter and compiler to several targets.
`Aeneas` is itself written in Virgil.
This is often called "self-hosted", meaning that a compiler is written in the language it accepts, and thus can compile itself.
But how does the Virgil compiler run, if not for another compiler or interpreter for Virgil?

## Self-hosting requires bootstrapping ##

The process of creating a *self-hosted* compiler `K` for a new programming language `L` is called *bootstrapping*.
This follows a tried-and-true pattern: before building the first compiler `K`, a compiler (or interpreter) for the language, `PreK`, is written in an existing language.
The very first compilers had no pre-existing language to bootstrap with; they were written in assembly or machine code.
The `PreK` implementation of `L` of Virgil III was an interpreter written in Java circa 2009 that was adapted from a Virgil II compiler, known as `VPC` (for Virgil Prototype Compiler) also written in Java.
When `Aeneas` running on `VPC` could finally generate an executable of itself, `VPC` became unnecessary.

## Virgil repo contains compiler binaries ##

Virgil III no longer requires a compiler written in a separate language to bootstrap--i.e. no more `VPC` written in Java.
Maintaining a separate compiler simply to bootstrap slows evolution and risks incompatibility.
In fact, the language has evolved to include new features, and these new features are used by the `Aeneas` compiler itself, so the original `VPC` for Virgil would no longer be able to compile or run today's compiler.

Nowadays, the Virgil repo maintains several *stable executable binaries* that are simply snapshots of the compiler compiling itself.
These stable executables are built from the source code in the repo using the immediately preceding stable binaries and then checked in.
Thus each revision in the repository history contains at least one stable binary capable of compiling the source code of the compiler in that same revision.
Each revision that introduces a new stable executable binary represents a checkpoint in the language evolution.
The stable binaries thus form a complete chain back to the very first bootstrap, the primordial executable that was first generated by `Aeneas` running on `VPC`.

## New features need a rev ##

New features for Virgil must first be implemented in the compiler, tested thoroughly, and a new set of stable binaries produced, before the feature can be used in the compiler's implementation itself.
This is to preserve the chain so that any revision of the compiler's source can be built with the corresponding stable binaries checked in at the same revision.

## Show-stopping compiler bugs ##

Compiler bugs carry increased risk for self-hosted languages, since miscompilation of the compiler itself may turn a rare bug into a bug that affects all programs (by affecting the behavior of the compiler itself).
This is particularly bad if the stable compiler has bugs, since the stable compiler is needed to bootstrap a new compiler.
Development of `Aeneas` tries to mitigate this problem by broad testing (the current repo contains over 14,000 mini-programs as tests) and bootstrap testing (the testsuite is always run twice, once on a compiler compiled with stable and once with the new compiler having compiled itself).

A compiler bug in stable could also prevent bootstrapping the compiler, e.g. if the stable compiler crashes on the new compiler.
To mitigate this, development of `Aeneas` always procedes in steps small enough to ensure that every revision can build with the stable compiler in the same revision.
If such a bug arises, it would first be fixed and the stable is rev'd.
To date, no show-stopper bug has yet appeared.

Bugs in stable do happen, however.
They are treated according to their severity; e.g. an incorrect rejection of a valid program is not as serious as a wrong code bug.
Generally, users are encouraged to work with a bootstrapped compiler (rather than stable) to subject the current compiler to as much testing as possible before the next stable revision.

## Reflections on Trusting Trust ##

In Ken Thompson's now famous Turing Award lecture, he demonstrated a backdoor that was inserted into the compiler's binary and then erased from its source.
The backdoor in the compiler pattern-matched the source code of specific programs (such as the `login` command) in order to insert vulnerabilities into them.
Interestingly, the compiler backdoor also pattern-matched the source code of *the compiler itself* and inserted the very same backdoor logic.
Thus the backdoor was not present in the source code of the compiler, only the binary, yet recompiling from source would reintroduce it, and unwary users would never know.
Without disassembling the compromised compiler or auditing its output, the backdoor and vulnerability would never be detected.

How does this break down for Virgil?
Don't we necessarily trust stable `Aeneas` compiler binaries to not have backdoors that insert vulnerabilities?
Yes, but we can *get more confidence* that these binaries do not contain backdoors because:

* _Diversity._ There are stable binaries for many different platforms
* _Determinism._ As a language with well-specified semantics and no platform-specific behavior, all stable compiler binaries produce bit-equivalent results, particularly when compiling the compiler itself
* _Auditability._ At the revision where a new stable compiler is checked in, we can run the compiler in the *interpreter* (even an external one), which has a tracing mode that we can actively verify the execution steps of interpreting the compiler
