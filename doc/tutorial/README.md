# Overview

This tutorial will teach you to the basic concepts of Virgil III, starting from basic concepts and progressing to more complex features.
It assumes a passing familiarity with at least one programming language that favors curly-braced syntax.

If you're already fairly skilled at *another* programming language, see [Coming From](ComingFrom.md) which gives a basic flavor of Virgil in relation to other languages.

Let's get started with your first program!
  * [Hello World](HelloWorld.md)

Now let's look at how to use variables.
  * [Variables and Definitions](Variables.md)

Let's add some structure to our code instead of one big jumble in a file.
  * [Components](Components.md)

Learn about numbers, booleans, strings, characters.
  * [Primitive Types](Primitives.md)

Methods make up most of the logic of programs.
  * [Methods](Methods.md)

Locals are how we store data in methods.
  * [Local Variables](Locals.md)

Arithmetic on numbers in Virgil is a lot more general than other programming languages.
  * [Arithmetic](Arith.md)

Arrays are key for storing large amounts of data.
  * [Arrays](Arrays.md)

Strings are key for dealing with files, text, etc.
  * [Strings](Strings.md)

Tuples are key for using multiple values where one value is expected.
  * [Tuples](Tuples.md)

Tuples and methods go together well in Virgil.
  * [Tuples and Methods](TuplesAndMethods.md)

Logic is done with familiar control constructs.
  * [Branches](Branches.md)
  * [Loops](Loops.md)

Virgil has switches and pattern matching.
  * [Matches](Matches.md)

Ternary expressions have a slightly different syntax in Virgil.
  * [Ternary Expressions](Ternary.md)

Logic operations are like arithmetic on booleans.
  * [Logical](Logical.md)

First-class functions and partial application give a flavor of functional programming.
  * [Functions](Functions.md)
  * [Partial Application](PartialApp.md)

Methods can have type parameters and be generic in their type.
  * [Method Type Parameters](Typeparams.md)

Classes are part of Virgil's support for object-oriented programming.
  * [Classes](Classes.md)
  * [Inheritance](Inheritance.md)

Classes have a nice syntax for immutable fields.
  * [Class Parameters](ClassParameters.md)

Classes and objects interact well with Virgil's functional programming support.
  * [Classes and Functions](ClassesAndFunctions.md)

Classes, too, can have type parameters and thus be generic.
  * [Class Type Parameters](ClassTypeParams.md)

Casts allow us to convert one type of data to another, and query the type of data or objects.
  * [Casts](Casts.md)

Type parameters don't have variance in Virgil; only subtyping on functions.
  * [Variance](Variance.md)

Put it all together!
  * [Synthesis](Synthesis.md)

Virgil doesn't yet have exceptions.
  * [Exceptions](Exceptions.md)

What kind of programming style should I use?
  * [Style](Style.md)

Some tricks that are used to make Virgil fast.
  * [Implementation notes](ImplNotes.md)
